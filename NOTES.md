node_modules is misleading - after I've managed to make app run once on one machine and uploaded it to git it wasn't working on my other machine - probably due to some config issues.
I didn't have initialy @types/figglet and @types/clear (I installed them w/o saving) and after adding them now import from './boards' is not working...
